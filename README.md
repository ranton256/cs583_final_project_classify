# cs583_final_project_classify
Final project for CS 583 Computer Vision.
Image Classification using PyTorch.

This uses a VGG 16 network architecture to classify images as either canine or feline.
The dataset used is a subset of Tiny ImageNet by grouping 11 original classes into two
new classes, canine and feline.
